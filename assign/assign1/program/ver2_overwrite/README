 This program creates a child thread, then uses ptrace() to overwrite the 
 beginning of the program with the code inside the many guards at main,
 thereby executing "Hello World!" before files need to be opened.

================================================================================
1. Run make to build the "exploit" program
	
	make

2. Run the exploit, this should print "Hello world!" regardless of what
   values are in file1, file2, file3, file4.
	
	./exploit
